                                Maximum overs per bowler are as Rule K6(c). The minimum overs for a tie shall be ten

                                allocation of overs per bowler. <br />
                                <span class="ul">Examples:</span> eg i) Should two bowlers bowl their allocated nine
                                overs
                                and the
                                innings loses 30 minutes, then five overs are deducted. This is now a 40 overs per side
                                game
                                and,
                                with 18 overs having already been bowled, 22 overs remain therefore the maximum number
                                of overs
                                per
                                bowler will now be 8. eg ii) Should three bowlers have bowled their nine overs and 60
                                minutes
                                are
                                lost, therefore 10 overs are lost. This is now a 35 overs per side game and, with 27
                                having
                                already
                                been bowled, 8 overs remain and therefore the maximum number of overs per bowler will
                                now be 4.
                                The
                                same calculation may also be used in the second innings. A part bowled over is
